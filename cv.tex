\section{Profile}
Full stack developer with a backend focus. I like to get involved in all parts of development to understand the big picture, from the frontend to the database.

As a programmer I produce simple and clear code, and when needed I’m not afraid to refactor my way there. I believe in choosing the right tool for the job, and love to learn new tools and technologies.

My ideal work environment is open, collaborative and challenging.

% I found out about you guys talking to Grey at Silicon milk roundabout. What got my attention straight away was that you guys are daringly using Elixir in production (favourite language at the moment). After working on a highly concurrent payment system in Scala I am eager to try something a bit more sane! :)

% I also gathered that you think code quality is important, which I like as someone who deeply values creating stuff that I can be proud of.

% It's probably worth mentioning that I don't have any ruby experience, so you'd have to be prepared that it'll be a few weeks before I'm fully up to speed. I love to learn new stuff and for me this is a great opportunity to learn how to code large systems in a dynamicly typed language.

% Looking forward to hearing from you!
